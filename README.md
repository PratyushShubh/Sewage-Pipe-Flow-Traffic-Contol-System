# Sewage-Pipe-Flow-Traffic-Contol-System


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
==================
"Developing an Arduino-based prototype system to monitor sewage flow and water levels in multiple passages, aiming to mitigate overflow pressures during rain events by automating valve controls."



Brief Description:
====
In response to localized rainstorms causing sewage passage overflows, this project aims to develop a prototype system using Arduino technology. The system will utilize water flow and level sensors strategically placed across multiple sewage passages. These sensors will provide real-time data on flow rates and water levels, enabling automated control of solenoid valves. By dynamically adjusting valve openings based on sensor inputs, the system aims to optimize sewage flow management. This solution aims to mitigate overflow pressures on the main water treatment plant during rain events, ensuring efficient and controlled sewage passage operation.

Lesson_1: Using 4 sensors to detect an object and turning LEDs ON
=======================================================
The circuit is as below:
